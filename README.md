Repository for Python Jupyter Notebooks developed as a member of NASA's Ocean Surface Topography from Space Science Team. Main notebooks (landerer.ipynb, landerer_all_t.ipynb, argo_landerer.ipynb, steric_height.ipynb, steric_height_contributions.ipynb, tide_gauge.ipynb, tide_gauge_only.ipynb) are observations- and ECCO- based analyses of ocean bottom pressure, sea surface height, and steric height spatio-temporal variability. Specifically, a sub-surface warming driven mass redistrubtion mechanism is evaluated in its ability to explain coastal sea level change.
